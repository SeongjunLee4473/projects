## ESA Sentinel-1
ESA's Sentinel-1 mission provides continuous, all-weather, and day-and-night radar imagery of Earth's surface through its Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument. The primary reason for using this data in water body detection is SAR's unique capability to penetrate cloud cover and darkness. This is crucial for monitoring floods and other dynamic water changes in near real-time, as optical satellites (which rely on visible light) are often obstructed by clouds during heavy rain or storms. Additionally, water bodies appear very dark in SAR imagery due to specular reflection, making them highly distinguishable from surrounding land features.

The data used in this project was obtained from the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) DAAC via its bulk download script, allowing for efficient acquisition of large, time-series datasets.
