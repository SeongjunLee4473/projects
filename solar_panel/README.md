# ☀️  Integrating AI-based Solar Panel Detection with WRF Model for Microclimate Impact Analysis
This project aims to precisely detect the location and area of solar panels by analyzing optical satellite band data with an AI model.
Furthermore, this high-resolution solar panel distribution data will be integrated into the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model to update existing land-use data to reflect real-world conditions and incorporate the panels' physical properties—such as albedo, surface roughness, and thermal characteristics—as land surface parameters.

Through this integrated modeling approach, the research will quantitatively analyze the effects of large-scale solar farms on local weather phenomena, including ambient temperature and wind circulation.

## 💾 Datasets
### 🛰️ NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (v2.0)
The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project, initiated by NASA, provides a powerful solution for Earth observation by combining data from the NASA Landsat-8/9 and ESA Sentinel-2 satellite missions.
The goal is to create a harmonized, or "sensor-agnostic," dataset of 30-meter resolution surface reflectance that can be used as if it were acquired by a single satellite **(Ju et al., 2025)**.

HLS processing applies the same algorithms to both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data to correct for atmospheric effects, normalize for view angle differences, and adjust for subtle spectral bandpass variations between the sensors **(Ju et al., 2025)**.

The result is an Analysis Ready Data (ARD) product that reduces the pre-processing burden for users. The HLS V2.0 dataset, completed in 2023, provides a global median of 66 cloud-free observations per year over land, significantly more than a single sensor could provide alone **(Ju et al., 2025)**.
