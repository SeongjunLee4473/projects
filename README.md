## üíß [AI-based Chlorophyll-a Prediction for Inland Water in South Korea](./water_quality)
This folder contains resources related to a research project focused on predicting Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in lakes and reservoirs within South Korea's inland waters.

The study utilizes optical satellite imagery in conjunction with AI models to develop robust prediction capabilities for Chl-a. This approach aims to provide timely and accurate monitoring of water quality, supporting environmental management and conservation efforts.

## üî• [AI-based Trend Analysis of Urban Heat Island: The Case of Gwangu, South Korea](./urban_heat_island)
This project analyzed and predicted trends in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Gwangju, South Korea using optical satellite data and machine learning (ML) approaches.

This research was conducted with the support of a grant from the Gwangju Climate & Energy Agency's **`Small Research Grant Program`**.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è [Integrating AI-based Solar Panel Detection with the WRF Model for Microclimate Impact Analysis](./solar_panel)
This project aims to precisely detect the location and area of solar panels by analyzing optical satellite band data with an AI model. Furthermore, this high-resolution solar panel distribution data will be integrated into the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model to update existing land-use data to reflect real-world conditions and incorporate the panels' physical properties‚Äîsuch as albedo, surface roughness, and thermal characteristics‚Äîas land surface parameters.

Through this integrated modeling approach, the research will quantitatively analyze the effects of large-scale solar farms on local weather phenomena, including ambient temperature and wind circulation.
