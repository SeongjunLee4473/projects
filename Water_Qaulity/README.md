# 💧 AI-based Chlorophyll-a Prediction for Inland Water in South Korea
This folder contains resources related to a research project focused on predicting Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in lakes and reservoirs within South Korea's inland waters.

The study utilizes optical satellite imagery in conjunction with AI models to develop robust prediction capabilities for Chl-a. This approach aims to provide timely and accurate monitoring of water quality, supporting environmental management and conservation efforts.

## 💾 Datasets
### 🛰️ NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (v2.0)

The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project, initiated by NASA, provides a powerful solution for Earth observation by combining data from the NASA Landsat-8/9 and ESA Sentinel-2 satellite missions.
The goal is to create a harmonized, or "sensor-agnostic," dataset of 30-meter resolution surface reflectance that can be used as if it were acquired by a single satellite **(Ju et al., 2025)**.

HLS processing applies the same algorithms to both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data to correct for atmospheric effects, normalize for view angle differences, and adjust for subtle spectral bandpass variations between the sensors **(Ju et al., 2025)**.
The result is an Analysis Ready Data (ARD) product that reduces the pre-processing burden for users. The HLS V2.0 dataset, completed in 2023, provides a global median of 66 cloud-free observations per year over land, significantly more than a single sensor could provide alone **(Ju et al., 2025)**.

### In-Situ Chloropyhll-a Data Provided by Water Environment Information System (물환경정보시스템)
The Water Environment Information System (WEIS) of South Korea is a service operated by the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER). It's a specialized portal that offers expert information related to water quality and aquatic ecosystems, including key data Chl-a.
This system centralizes various measurement data and information on the water environment to support public services and research.
